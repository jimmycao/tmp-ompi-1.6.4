# Note that -lopen-pal and all the EXTRA_LIBS are only necessary when
# static linking (they're pulled in by libopen-rte.so's implicit
# dependencies), so only list these in Libs.private.

# It is safe to hard-wire the -I before the EXTRA_INCLUDES because it
# will either contain "openmpi" or be blank.  Hence, it'll either
# resolve to ${includedir} or ${includedir}/something.  The former is
# redundant (ick), but safe.

Cflags: -I${includedir} -I${includedir}/openmpi -I/root/program/orte/include/openmpi/opal/mca/hwloc/hwloc132/hwloc/include -pthread
